# My notes for Git & GitHub

---

## What is Git?

Git is a version control tool that helps us save our code. It keeps all the changes we make to code or any project files that we have.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website. It saves our code online. So we can share it and work with others.

## Common Git Stuff

- `git init` - initialize git in a folder
- `git add .` - stage all changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - commit changes
- `git push origin branch-name` - push code to GitHub
